#Course dataset

This is the training data to get you started that will be the basis for most of the capstone. You must download the data from the link below and not from external websites to start.

Later in the course you may use external data sets to augment your model as you see fit.

#Course Project

This course will start with the basics, analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together. It will cover cleaning and analyzing text data, then building and sampling from a predictive text model. Finally, you will use the knowledge you gained in data products to build a predictive text product you can show off to your family, friends, and potential employers.

#Repository Contents

This repository contains the files used to create the training dataset for the shiny application, the shiny application code and a presentation submitted for this project.
